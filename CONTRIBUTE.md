PR's are welcome, especially for adding new sources!

## Adding new sources

If you're PRing with a new source(s), please make sure that you are recognizing the license / copyright on the source material as well as this project's license. This project is MIT licensed.

## Adding new features

If you're fixing bugs or adding new features, I don't impose any strict formatting / syntax rules except that you try to stick to the conventions established in existing code in the repository.

Please note that [I don't use semicolons](https://medium.com/@goatslacker/no-you-dont-need-semicolons-148d936b9cf2) in JS code, and that's _fine_.
